do we need to apply any error hanfdlin in @cortex/responses/state.py ? lets go thorugh each file one by one again
‚éø Read cortex/responses/state.py (19 lines)

‚óè üìã state.py Analysis: Minimal Error Handling Needed

Looking at state.py, this file is very low-risk for error handling because:

‚úÖ What's Good (No Changes Needed)

- Pure Type Definitions: Just TypedDict schema, no runtime logic
- LangGraph Integration: Uses proper add_messages annotation
- Type Safety: All fields are properly typed

‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Improvements (Optional)

1. Field Validation (Low Priority)

# Could add constraints, but TypedDict doesn't support runtime validation

response_id: str # Should we validate format? (resp_xxxxx)
model: str # Should we validate against known models?

2. Documentation Enhancement
   class ResponsesState(TypedDict):
   """State for managing conversations in Responses API"""
   messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], add_messages] # Conversation history
   response_id: str # Current response ID (req)
   previous_response_id: Optional[str] # For continuity (opt)
   input: str # User's input message (req)
   instructions: Optional[str] # System instructions (opt)
   model: str # LLM model name (req)
   store: bool # Persistence flag (req)

üéØ Recommendation: SKIP state.py for now

Why:

- No runtime logic = No error conditions
- Type safety already handled by Python/LangGraph
- Validation belongs elsewhere (in create.py where state is built)

üìÅ File Priority for Error Handling

High Priority (Real Logic):

1. cortex/responses/methods/create.py ‚Üê START HERE
2. cortex/responses/api.py
3. cortex/responses/llm.py
4. cortex/responses/persistence.py

Low Priority (Schema/Config): 5. cortex/responses/state.py 6. cortex/models/registry.py

Next: Let's examine create.py - that's where most errors will occur (LLM calls, validation, database operations).

Ready to analyze cortex/responses/methods/create.py?
