This mirrors how OpenAI separates their APIs and makes it easier to maintain. Each API folder becomes its own module with everything it needs. Much cleaner!

The user likes this idea and we're just planning. I should keep my response concise as they just wanted my opinion on the structure.

from .responses import ResponsesAPI

**version** = "0.1.0"
**all** = ["ResponsesAPI"]" what does this code even mean

● This is the package initialization file that makes cortex importable. Here's what each part does:

Line 3: from .responses import ResponsesAPI

- Imports ResponsesAPI from the responses module
- The dot (.) means "from this package"

Line 5: **version** = "0.1.0"

- Package version number
- Users can check version with cortex.**version**

Line 6: **all** = ["ResponsesAPI"]

- Controls what gets imported with from cortex import \*
- Only exports ResponsesAPI publicly

Result: Users can do:
from cortex import ResponsesAPI # Works because of line 3

Instead of:
from cortex.responses import ResponsesAPI # Longer import path

This file needs updating since we moved ResponsesAPI to cortex/responses/api.py.

✻ Thinking…

The user is asking about creating a TypedDict for the Responses API. They want me to carefully analyze the OpenAI Responses API documentation and create a proper state
structure for LangGraph that matches OpenAI's functionality.

Looking at the OpenAI Responses API docs (saiyaara.md), here are the key request parameters:

- input (string or array) - The user's message/input
- model (string) - Model to use
- previous_response_id (string or null) - For conversation continuity
- instructions (string or null) - System/developer message
- store (boolean, defaults to true) - Whether to persist
- temperature, top_p - Sampling parameters
- max_output_tokens - Token limit
- tools - Array of tools the model can use
- tool_choice - How to select tools
- metadata - Key-value pairs for additional info
- stream - For streaming responses
- And many more...

The response contains:

- id - Unique response ID
- status - completed, failed, etc.
- model - Model used
- output - Array of content items (messages)
- previous_response_id - Reference to previous conversation
- usage - Token usage details
- And more...

For LangGraph state management, we need:

1. Messages list with Annotated[List[BaseMessage], add_messages] - Essential for conversation history
2. previous_response_id - For conversation continuity
3. Current response_id - To track current conversation
4. instructions - System prompt
5. model - Which LLM to use
6. store - Whether to persist
7. metadata - Additional info
8. status - Current processing status

The user is right that messages with add_messages annotation is crucial - it's how LangGraph automatically handles message accumulation.

Let me create a plan for the TypedDict that captures the essential parts of the Responses API while being compatible with LangGraph's state management.

● Looking at the OpenAI Responses API documentation, here's my plan for the TypedDict:

Essential Fields for ResponsesState:

1. messages ✅ (You're right, this is crucial!)

messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], add_messages]

- Core of any conversation system
- LangGraph uses this to accumulate messages automatically

2. previous_response_id ✅ (Critical for continuity)

previous_response_id: Optional[str]

- Links conversations together
- Enables multi-turn conversations

3. response_id (Current conversation ID)

response_id: str

- Unique identifier for this response
- Used as previous_response_id in next turn

4. input (User's message)

input: str

- The actual user query/message
- Gets converted to HumanMessage

5. instructions (System prompt)

instructions: Optional[str]

- Customizable assistant behavior
- Like "You are a helpful tutor"

6. model (LLM selection)

model: str

- Which model to use (cohere/gpt-4/etc)
- Allows dynamic model switching

7. store (Persistence flag)

store: bool

- Whether to save conversation
- Defaults to True like OpenAI

8. metadata (Extra info)

> This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
> Analysis:
> Looking through the conversation chronologically:

1. Initial context: User shared their vision for "Cortex" - an open-source library/framework to replicate OpenAI's Assistants and Responses APIs using LangGraph. They have
   extensive development experience (Django, cloud, Next.js, low-code platforms) but haven't built something like this before.

2. User studied LangGraph concepts through their plan files and sample codes, understanding:

   - StateGraph as a process cycle with state, nodes, and edges
   - TypedDict for defining state structure
   - Annotated[List[BaseMessage], add_messages] for automatic message combining
   - Nodes as processing functions, edges as connectors

3. User's core vision evolved: Build a framework that other developers can use (like LangGraph/CrewAI), not just a coaching app. They want to prove that what Hassan built
   for $400K with OpenAI can be recreated by a single engineer with open-source tools.

4. Technical discussions covered:

   - Python vs TypeScript (Python chosen for AI ecosystem)
   - Framework structure inspired by LangChain and CrewAI
   - Integration with Next.js via API calls
   - Focus on simplicity - hiding LangGraph complexity behind simple APIs

5. Most recent work: User wants to focus specifically on the Responses API implementation and asked about framework structure. I provided a detailed structure, but they
   want it simplified and have questions about Python packaging files.

Key user feedback:

- "lets remove the additional parts and only keep the ones we will be using like responses and essential stuff"
- Questions about **init**.py, setup.py, and toml files

Summary:

1. Primary Request and Intent:

   - Build an open-source library/framework called "Cortex" that replicates OpenAI's Assistants and Responses APIs using LangGraph
   - Create a developer-friendly framework that hides complexity (like OpenAI does) while using free LLMs (Cohere)
   - Focus on Responses API implementation first
   - Prove that expensive proprietary AI systems can be democratized by a single skilled engineer
   - Build both a reusable library AND a coaching app demo (17 coaches like Hassan's system)
   - Make it pip-installable so developers can use it easily

2. Key Technical Concepts:

   - LangGraph StateGraph for conversation orchestration
   - TypedDict for state definition
   - Annotated[List[BaseMessage], add_messages] for automatic message management
   - Nodes (processing functions) and Edges (flow connectors)
   - Conditional edges for multi-agent routing
   - SqliteSaver for conversation persistence
   - Cohere LLM as free alternative to OpenAI
   - Python framework structure (packages, modules, setup.py)

   - /mnt/e/cortexAI/cortex/data/openai_assistants_api.md

     - OpenAI Assistants API documentation
     - Shows complex polling-based workflow that Responses API simplifies

   - /mnt/e/cortexAI/cortex/data/openai_responses_api.md

     - OpenAI Responses API documentation
     - Key features: single API call, previous_response_id for conversation continuation, store=true for persistence
     - Shows simpler API compared to Assistants

   - /mnt/e/cortexAI/cortex/data/plan1.md

     - User's initial learning of LangGraph concepts

4. Errors and fixes:

   - No explicit errors encountered yet as we're still in planning phase
   - User feedback on complexity: Asked to simplify the framework structure and focus only on essential parts

5. Problem Solving:

   - Solved: Understanding how to map OpenAI's APIs to LangGraph concepts
   - Solved: Choosing Python over TypeScript for AI ecosystem compatibility
   - Ongoing: Simplifying framework structure to essentials only

6. All user messages:

   - "what do you think of all this and differnt plans and data i collected"
   - "now ill share what i know so far, then i need you to think about all this and tell me your opinion and how to proceed"
   - "okay time to implement it in actaul code , so what sthe plan for it"
   - "is it better to make it on python or can we make it on typescript"
   - "do you thin what i have envisioned is even worth it"
   - "lets forst start working on repsonses api @data/openai_responses_api.md , but before that how would frwewoirk struicture look like"
   - "int he structure you provide lets remove the additoional parts andf only keep the ones we will be suing like repsonses and essential stuff, what is this init.py file
     in each folder why do we need it , what is this wsetup.py and toml file"

7. Pending Tasks:

   - Simplify framework structure to essential components only
   - Explain Python packaging files (**init**.py, setup.py, pyproject.toml)
   - Start implementing the Responses API

8. Current Work:
   I just provided a detailed framework structure for Cortex, showing how to organize the codebase professionally. The user wants this simplified to only essential parts
   for the Responses API and needs explanation of Python packaging files:

   - **init**.py files in each folder
   - setup.py file
   - pyproject.toml file

9. Optional Next Step:
   Provide a simplified framework structure focusing only on Responses API essentials and explain the purpose of Python packaging files (**init**.py, setup.py,
   pyproject.toml) that the user asked about.

   Direct quote from user's most recent message: "int he structure you provide lets remove the additoional parts andf only keep the ones we will be suing like repsonses and
   essential stuff, what is this init.py file in each folder why do we need it , what is this wsetup.py and toml file".
   Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

● Summary

I've created a simplified Cortex framework structure focused on the Responses API:

What Each File Does:

1. pyproject.toml - Modern package configuration that makes your framework pip-installable
2. **init**.py files - Make folders importable as Python packages
3. responses.py - Core ResponsesAPI implementation using LangGraph
4. state.py - Defines conversation state structure
5. llm.py - Handles LLM provider integration (Cohere)

Key Features Implemented:

✅ Simple API - api.create() just like OpenAI
✅ Conversation Continuation - previous_response_id support
✅ Custom Instructions - Dynamic personality/behavior
✅ Persistence - Automatic conversation storage

Next Steps:

1. Install dependencies: pip install -e . in the cortex directory
2. Get Cohere API key: Sign up at cohere.ai (it's free)
3. Set environment variable: export COHERE_API_KEY="your-key"
4. Test it: Run python example.py

This simplified structure gives you a working Responses API alternative that developers can use just like OpenAI's, but with free Cohere LLMs!

> alrigth what @cortex/core/ basically has typed dict declaration and @cortex/utils/ has differnt llms and theior configurations and @cortex/responses.py is where state graph
> is set and @example.py is wherw we test it out?

● Yes, exactly! Here's the breakdown:

📁 cortex/core/ - TypedDict state definition (ConversationState)
📁 cortex/utils/ - LLM configurations (Cohere setup)📄 cortex/responses.py - StateGraph setup and ResponsesAPI
📄 example.py - Test script showing usage

The structure follows the pattern from your sample_codes.md but simplified to essentials:

- State management (like your coaching app's state)
- LLM provider abstraction (easy to swap providers)
- Clean API that hides LangGraph complexity
- Example showing conversation continuity

Ready to test it out with python example.py once you set your Cohere API key!

> yes we are first tryong to implemnt and repleicate openai repsonses api

● Update Todos
⎿ ☒ Study OpenAI Responses API documentation
☒ Implement basic ResponsesAPI with create() method
☒ Add conversation persistence with previous_response_id
☒ Add custom instructions support
☐ Test the implementation matches OpenAI behavior
☐ Add FastAPI wrapper for HTTP API
☐ Add multi-agent routing for Assistants API

> shpouldnt isntead of habvinf folders liek @cortex/core/ and @cortex/utils/ we have a folder by the name of responses in @cortex/ and we make our entire responses api in
> here, waht do you think, no code implementation we are only planning right now

✻ Thinking…

The user is suggesting a different folder structure. Instead of having core/ and utils/ folders, they want to have a responses/ folder inside cortex/ where all the
Responses API implementation would live. This makes sense from an organizational perspective - keeping all related code for a specific API together.

Let me think about this structure:

- cortex/responses/ - All Responses API related code
  - Could contain state.py, llm.py, api.py, etc.
- This would be cleaner and more modular
- When they add Assistants API later, they could have cortex/assistants/

The user explicitly said "no code implementation we are only planning right now" so I should just discuss the structure, not implement anything.

● Yes, that's a much better structure! Having a dedicated cortex/responses/ folder makes more sense because:

1. Modular Organization - All Responses API code in one place
2. Scalability - When you add Assistants API later, you'd have cortex/assistants/
3. Clear Separation - Each API is self-contained with its own state, LLM configs, etc.

So the structure would be:
cortex/
├── cortex/
│ ├── **init**.py
│ └── responses/
│ ├── **init**.py
│ ├── api.py # Main ResponsesAPI class
│ ├── state.py # ConversationState TypedDict
│ └── llm.py # LLM configurations

This mirrors how OpenAI separates their APIs and makes it easier to maintain. Each API folder becomes its own module with everything it needs. Much cleaner!

✻ Thinking…

The user likes this idea and we're just planning. I should keep my response concise as they just wanted my opinion on the structure.

from .responses import ResponsesAPI

**version** = "0.1.0"
**all** = ["ResponsesAPI"]" what does this code even mean

● This is the package initialization file that makes cortex importable. Here's what each part does:

Line 3: from .responses import ResponsesAPI

- Imports ResponsesAPI from the responses module
- The dot (.) means "from this package"

Line 5: **version** = "0.1.0"

- Package version number
- Users can check version with cortex.**version**

Line 6: **all** = ["ResponsesAPI"]

- Controls what gets imported with from cortex import \*
- Only exports ResponsesAPI publicly

Result: Users can do:
from cortex import ResponsesAPI # Works because of line 3

Instead of:
from cortex.responses import ResponsesAPI # Longer import path

This file needs updating since we moved ResponsesAPI to cortex/responses/api.py.

✻ Thinking…

The user is asking about creating a TypedDict for the Responses API. They want me to carefully analyze the OpenAI Responses API documentation and create a proper state
structure for LangGraph that matches OpenAI's functionality.

Looking at the OpenAI Responses API docs (saiyaara.md), here are the key request parameters:

- input (string or array) - The user's message/input
- model (string) - Model to use
- previous_response_id (string or null) - For conversation continuity
- instructions (string or null) - System/developer message
- store (boolean, defaults to true) - Whether to persist
- temperature, top_p - Sampling parameters
- max_output_tokens - Token limit
- tools - Array of tools the model can use
- tool_choice - How to select tools
- metadata - Key-value pairs for additional info
- stream - For streaming responses
- And many more...

The response contains:

- id - Unique response ID
- status - completed, failed, etc.
- model - Model used
- output - Array of content items (messages)
- previous_response_id - Reference to previous conversation
- usage - Token usage details
- And more...

For LangGraph state management, we need:

1. Messages list with Annotated[List[BaseMessage], add_messages] - Essential for conversation history
2. previous_response_id - For conversation continuity
3. Current response_id - To track current conversation
4. instructions - System prompt
5. model - Which LLM to use
6. store - Whether to persist
7. metadata - Additional info
8. status - Current processing status

The user is right that messages with add_messages annotation is crucial - it's how LangGraph automatically handles message accumulation.

Let me create a plan for the TypedDict that captures the essential parts of the Responses API while being compatible with LangGraph's state management.

● Looking at the OpenAI Responses API documentation, here's my plan for the TypedDict:

Essential Fields for ResponsesState:

1. messages ✅ (You're right, this is crucial!)

messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], add_messages]

- Core of any conversation system
- LangGraph uses this to accumulate messages automatically

2. previous_response_id ✅ (Critical for continuity)

previous_response_id: Optional[str]

- Links conversations together
- Enables multi-turn conversations

3. response_id (Current conversation ID)

response_id: str

- Unique identifier for this response
- Used as previous_response_id in next turn

4. input (User's message)

input: str

- The actual user query/message
- Gets converted to HumanMessage

5. instructions (System prompt)

instructions: Optional[str]

- Customizable assistant behavior
- Like "You are a helpful tutor"

6. model (LLM selection)

model: str

- Which model to use (cohere/gpt-4/etc)
- Allows dynamic model switching

7. store (Persistence flag)

store: bool

- Whether to save conversation
- Defaults to True like OpenAI

8. metadata (Extra info)

metadata: Optional[Dict[str, str]]

- Custom key-value pairs
- For tracking/filtering

Why These Fields?

- messages - LangGraph requirement for conversation flow
- previous_response_id - OpenAI's key innovation for stateless conversation continuation
- response_id - Need to generate and track current ID
- input - User's actual message
- instructions - Dynamic personality/behavior
- model - Multi-model support
- store - Control persistence
- metadata - Extensibility

This gives us OpenAI-compatible API while working perfectly with LangGraph's StateGraph pattern!

> " 2. previous_response_id ✅ (Critical for continuity)

    previous_response_id: Optional[str]
    - Links conversations together
    - Enables multi-turn conversations

    3. response_id (Current conversation ID)

    response_id: str
    - Unique identifier for this response
    - Used as previous_response_id in next turn" shoudnt this be same ort am i wrong ?, why do we have metadata and i think for an mvp foundational api i dont think store is

soemthing i want to implement right now but can be doen for future

✻ Thinking…

The user is asking about the difference between previous_response_id and response_id. They're actually different - one is for the previous conversation turn, one is for the
current turn. Let me clarify this.

Also, they're right about metadata and store - for an MVP, we should keep it simple. Let me explain the difference between the IDs clearly.

● You're asking a great question! They're actually different:

previous_response_id = ID from the LAST conversation turn (input)
response_id = ID for THIS current turn (output)

Example flow:

1. First message:


    - previous_response_id: None
    - response_id: "abc123" (generated)

2. Second message:


    - previous_response_id: "abc123" (from last turn)
    - response_id: "def456" (new one generated)

3. Third message:


    - previous_response_id: "def456"
    - response_id: "ghi789"

You're absolutely right about metadata and store - let's drop them for MVP!

Simplified ResponsesState for MVP:

class ResponsesState(TypedDict):
messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], add_messages]
response_id: str # Current turn ID
previous_response_id: Optional[str] # Last turn ID
input: str # User's message
instructions: Optional[str] # System prompt
model: str # Which LLM to use

This gives us:

- Conversation flow (messages)
- Continuity (previous_response_id linking)
- Customization (instructions, model)
- Simplicity (no extra fluff)

Perfect for MVP that matches OpenAI's core functionality!

✻ Thinking…

The user is asking some really good questions about how the OpenAI Responses API works:

1. What's the point of metadata and why does OpenAI have it?
2. When starting a new conversation, there's no previous_response_id, but there are instructions
3. If we send both previous_response_id AND instructions, what happens? Are instructions discarded?
4. Does previous_response_id contain context about the ENTIRE conversation or just the one message before?

Let me think through this carefully:

1. Metadata - OpenAI uses this for custom tracking/filtering. Like adding user_id, session_id, topic tags, etc. It's for developer convenience.
2. Instructions behavior - Looking at the OpenAI docs, instructions are only used when starting a NEW conversation (no previous_response_id). If you provide previous_response_id,  
   the instructions from that conversation thread are maintained, and any new instructions are ignored.
3. Context scope - previous_response_id links to the ENTIRE conversation history, not just the last message. It's like a thread ID that contains all previous messages in that  
   conversation.

Let me explain this clearly to the user.

● Excellent questions! Let me clarify how OpenAI's Responses API actually works:

1. Metadata Purpose

Used for custom tracking like:

- user_id: "john123"
- session_id: "chat-45"
- topic: "python-help"

Helps developers filter/search conversations later. Not needed for MVP.

2. Instructions Behavior

- New conversation (no previous_response_id): Instructions are SET
- Continuing conversation (with previous_response_id): New instructions are IGNORED

Example:

# First message - instructions are saved

response1 = api.create(
input="Hi",
instructions="You are a pirate" # SAVED
)

# Second message - new instructions ignored

response2 = api.create(
input="Tell me about coding",
previous_response_id=response1.id,
instructions="You are a teacher" # IGNORED - still a pirate!
)

3. Context Scope

previous_response_id links to the ENTIRE conversation history, not just last message!

Message 1: "Hi" → ID: abc123
Message 2: "How are you?" → ID: def456 (has full context of Message 1)
Message 3: "Tell me a joke" → ID: ghi789 (has context of Messages 1 AND 2)

It's like a thread ID that accumulates all messages. That's why LangGraph's checkpointer is perfect - it stores the full conversation state!

⎿ ☒ Read openai_assistants_api.md
☒ Read openai_responses_api.md
☒ Read plan1.md
☒ Read plan2.md
☒ Read sample_codes.md
☒ Synthesize understanding of cortex project
☒ Explain Python packaging files
☒ Create simplified framework structure
☒ Set up initial codebase
☐ Design ResponsesState TypedDict
☐ Implement state.py with ResponsesState
☐ Implement api.py with ResponsesAPI class
☐ Implement llm.py with LLM configurations

● Great question! It's NOT the Annotated list that does this - it's LangGraph's checkpointer!

Here's how the magic works:

1. Annotated[List[BaseMessage], add_messages]

This only combines messages within a single run:

# Single execution

state = {"messages": [HumanMessage("Hi")]}

# add_messages appends new messages

state = {"messages": [HumanMessage("Hi"), AIMessage("Hello!")]}

2. The Real Magic: SqliteSaver (Checkpointer)

checkpointer = SqliteSaver.from_conn_string("conversations.db")
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

# First conversation

config1 = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "abc123"}}
app.invoke(state1, config1) # SAVES full state to DB

# Later...

config2 = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "abc123"}}
app.invoke(state2, config2) # LOADS previous state from DB!

3. How It Actually Works

- previous_response_id → becomes thread_id
- Checkpointer stores ENTIRE conversation state in SQLite
- When you pass same thread_id, it loads ALL previous messages

Database:
thread_id: "abc123" → messages: [Human("Hi"), AI("Hello"), Human("How are you"), AI("Great!")]

So the Annotated list handles message appending WITHIN a run, while the checkpointer handles persistence ACROSS runs!

> yes but when we use openai apis , we dont really have to wrorty about this yes? this is done by them i mean we can also store rresponses on our own , what about store whcih is  
>  pricoided by openai as a paramter which can be set as true , how is it different

● Exactly! You've hit the key difference!

OpenAI's Approach:

# OpenAI handles EVERYTHING internally

response = client.responses.create(
input="Hello",
store=True # OpenAI stores it in THEIR database
)

# Continue conversation - OpenAI fetches from THEIR storage

response2 = client.responses.create(
input="How are you?",
previous_response_id=response.id # OpenAI loads full history
)

What store=true Does:

- store=true: OpenAI saves conversation in their cloud
- store=false: OpenAI returns response but doesn't save (one-time use)

Our Cortex Approach:

We need to handle storage ourselves:

# We use LangGraph's checkpointer

checkpointer = SqliteSaver("local.db") # LOCAL storage

# store=true → use checkpointer

# store=false → don't use checkpointer

Key Difference:

- OpenAI: Black box - they handle all storage/retrieval
- Cortex: We implement storage using LangGraph's checkpointer

This is actually BETTER because:

- Data stays local (privacy)
- No API rate limits
- Free storage
- Full control

So yes, OpenAI hides all this complexity, but with LangGraph we can replicate it using the checkpointer!
