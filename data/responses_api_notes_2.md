- OpenAI: Black box - they handle all storage/retrieval
- Cortex: We implement storage using LangGraph's checkpointer

This is actually BETTER because:

- Data stays local (privacy)
- No API rate limits
- Free storage
- Full control

So yes, OpenAI hides all this complexity, but with LangGraph we can replicate it using the checkpointer!

2. response_id - Current turn's unique ID
3. previous_response_id - Links to previous conversation
4. input - User's message
5. instructions - System prompt for behavior
6. model - Which LLM to use
7. store - Whether to persist (kept it for future use)

The TypedDict is now ready. Each field has a clear purpose for replicating OpenAI's Responses API functionality with LangGraph.

● Great idea! Let's plan the LLM settings structure. Here's what we need to consider:

LLM Configuration Plan:

1. Model Registry Pattern

MODELS = {
"cohere-command": {...},
"gpt-4": {...},
"claude-3": {...}
}

- Easy to add new models
- Centralized configuration

2. What Each Model Needs:

- Provider (cohere, openai, anthropic)
- Model name (command-r-plus, gpt-4, claude-3-sonnet)
- Default settings (temperature, max_tokens)
- API key handling (environment variables)
- Cost info (for future billing features)

3. Key Design Decisions:

A) Environment Variables:

- COHERE_API_KEY
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

B) Default Model:

- Start with Cohere (free)
- Easy to switch via model parameter

C) Factory Pattern:
def get_llm(model_name: str) -> BaseChatModel: # Returns configured LLM instance

4. Why This Approach:

- Extensible - Add new models easily
- Clean API - Users just pass model name
- Flexible - Override settings per request
- Future-proof - Ready for multi-provider support

5. MVP Focus:

- Start with just Cohere
- Structure allows easy expansion
- Keep configuration simple

Does this plan align with your vision? Should we focus on just Cohere for MVP or include structure for multiple providers?

> so i was thinking about this, so the main difference between iopenai and our integration is with our implekemtnation you can pretty much use any llm , but how is that even

● Great question! Let me clarify how this works:

You DON'T need to study each provider's API!

Why? Because LangChain already did this work for you!

How it works:

1. Direct API Approach (Hard way):

# You'd need different code for each provider

cohere_response = cohere.Client().chat(...) # Cohere's way
openai_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(...) # OpenAI's way
anthropic_response = anthropic.Client().messages.create(...) # Anthropic's way

2. LangChain Approach (Easy way - what we use):
   from langchain_cohere import ChatCohere
   from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
   from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

# ALL use the same interface!

llm = ChatCohere() # or ChatOpenAI() or ChatAnthropic()
response = llm.invoke("Hello") # SAME method for all!

What LangChain does:

- Wraps each provider's API
- Standardizes them to one interface
- Handles authentication, formatting, errors
- You just use .invoke() for everything!

Yes, it still makes API calls:

Your Code → LangChain → Provider's API → Response

But you only need to learn LangChain's interface, not each provider's!

For MVP:

Just implement the LangChain wrapper pattern:
def get_llm(model: str):
if model == "cohere":
return ChatCohere()
elif model == "gpt-4":
return ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4") # Easy to add more!

This is the magic - LangChain abstracts away all the provider differences!

> but if we are still making th api call, wount this make the proje t we are making kind of useless

● NO! Your project is absolutely NOT useless! Here's why:

What OpenAI Responses API Does:

# OpenAI's closed system

response = openai.responses.create(
input="Hello",
previous_response_id="abc123" # Magic happens in OpenAI's servers
)

What You're Building:

# Your open system

response = cortex.responses.create(
input="Hello",
previous_response_id="abc123", # YOU control the magic
model="cohere" # Can use ANY LLM!
)

The REAL Value:

1. Conversation Management (The hard part!)


    - OpenAI: Locked to their system
    - Cortex: YOU implement persistence, threading, state

2. Multi-LLM Support


    - OpenAI: Only GPT models
    - Cortex: Cohere, Claude, Llama, ANY model

3. Cost Savings


    - OpenAI: $20-40 per million tokens
    - Cortex + Cohere: FREE tier available

4. Data Privacy


    - OpenAI: Data on their servers
    - Cortex: Local storage, your control

5. Customization


    - OpenAI: Black box
    - Cortex: Modify anything, add features

You're Building the ORCHESTRATION Layer:

Hassan's $400K system = OpenAI API calls + Complex orchestration
Your Cortex = Free LLMs + YOUR orchestration code

The API calls are just one piece - the REAL value is in the conversation management, state handling, and multi-agent orchestration that YOU'RE building!

> so i lreasdy have my CO_API_KEY in env, also imported some docs reference about cohere from langachian, docs has really been updated since lasdt time i used it, check
> @llms_langchain_docs.md
> ⎿ Read llms_langchain_docs.md (1623 lines)

● Perfect! You have the Cohere API key already set up. Looking at the LangChain docs you shared, here's my plan for the LLM configuration:

LLM Configuration Plan for llm.py:

1. Start Simple with Cohere (MVP)

from langchain_cohere import ChatCohere

def get_llm(model: str = "cohere"):
if model == "cohere":
return ChatCohere(model="command-r-plus")

2. Model Registry Structure (Scalable)

MODELS = {
"cohere": {
"class": ChatCohere,
"default_model": "command-r-plus",
"free": True
},
"cohere-light": {
"class": ChatCohere,
"default_model": "command-r",
"free": True
}
}

3. Why This Approach:

Simple Factory Pattern:

- User just passes model name: "cohere"
- We handle the LangChain instantiation
- Easy to add new models later

Key Benefits:

- No API Details Needed - LangChain handles all provider differences
- Unified Interface - All models use .invoke() method
- Free Tier Focus - Start with Cohere's free models
- Easy Extension - Add OpenAI/Anthropic later with 3 lines

4. Future Expansion:

# Easy to add later:

"gpt-4": {
"class": ChatOpenAI,
"default_model": "gpt-4",
"free": False
}

5. What We DON'T Need:

- Direct API calls to Cohere
- Complex authentication logic (LangChain handles it)
- Provider-specific code
- Multiple configuration files

Should we implement this simple LLM configuration now?

☐ Implement llm.py with LLM configurations
☐ Implement api.py with ResponsesAPI class

● Great idea! Separating the model registry makes it cleaner. Here's the plan:

Separated Model Registry Structure:

1. New Folder Structure:

cortex/
├── models/
│ ├── **init**.py
│ └── registry.py # All model configurations
└── responses/
├── **init**.py
├── api.py
├── state.py
└── llm.py # Just selection logic

2. Model Registry (models/registry.py):

# All model configurations in one place

MODELS = {
"command-r": {
"provider": "cohere",
"model_name": "command-r",
"temperature": 0.7,
"free": True
}, # Future models: # "gpt-4": {...}, # "claude-3": {...}
}

3. LLM Selection Logic (responses/llm.py):

from langchain_cohere import ChatCohere
from cortex.models.registry import MODELS

def get_llm(model_id: str = "command-r"): # Get config from registry
config = MODELS.get(model_id)

      # Switch based on provider
      if config["provider"] == "cohere":
          return ChatCohere(
              model=config["model_name"],
              temperature=config["temperature"]
          )
      # Future providers:
      # elif config["provider"] == "openai":
      #     return ChatOpenAI(...)

4. Benefits of This Approach:

- Clean Separation - Models config vs selection logic
- Easy to Add Models - Just update registry
- Provider Logic - Clear switch statements
- Reusable - Other APIs can use same registry

5. For MVP with command-r only:

- Start with just command-r in registry
- Simple switch with one case
- Ready to expand later

This gives you clean architecture while keeping it simple for MVP. Should we create this structure?

✻ Thinking…

The user is asking about the "free": True field and questioning the config approach. They're suggesting a simpler approach where:

1. Registry has a big object of models
2. Developer passes string like "cohere"
3. We loop through and match the string
4. If found, create ChatCohere instance
5. If not found, return error

They want to understand if this is a good approach. Let me explain both approaches clearly.

● You're absolutely right! Let's simplify it. The "free": True was just metadata (to track which models are free vs paid), but we don't really need it for MVP.

Here's your simpler approach which is actually better:

Your Approach (Better for MVP):

1. Registry (models/registry.py):

MODELS = {
"cohere": {
"provider": "cohere",
"model_name": "command-r"
},
"gpt-4": {
"provider": "openai",
"model_name": "gpt-4"
} # More models...
}

2. LLM Function (responses/llm.py):

from langchain_cohere import ChatCohere
from cortex.models.registry import MODELS

def get_llm(model_str: str): # Loop through registry
for key, config in MODELS.items():
if key == model_str: # Match found!
if config["provider"] == "cohere":
return ChatCohere(model=config["model_name"]) # elif config["provider"] == "openai": # return ChatOpenAI(...)

      # No match found
      raise ValueError(f"Model '{model_str}' not found in registry")

3. Even Simpler (Just for Cohere MVP):

def get_llm(model_str: str):
if model_str == "cohere":
return ChatCohere(model="command-r")
else:
raise ValueError(f"Model '{model_str}' not supported")

Your approach is cleaner because:

- Developer just passes "cohere"
- Simple string matching
- Clear error if model not found
- No unnecessary metadata

Should we implement this simpler version?

✻ Thinking…

The user is asking me to implement the simpler version of the LLM configuration. They want a simple approach where we just match strings and return the appropriate LLM instance.  
 Let me implement this now.

> will a swtch statement make it more cleaner then using if else and all that and we are basically enumarting through the dictionary ?

● Yes! A switch statement (match/case in Python 3.10+) would be much cleaner! Here's the comparison:

Match/Case (Python 3.10+) - Cleanest:

def get*llm(model_str: str):
match model_str:
case "cohere":
return ChatCohere(model="command-r")
case "gpt-4":
return ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")
case "claude":
return ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3")
case *:
raise ValueError(f"Model '{model_str}' not supported")

Dictionary Dispatch (Also Clean):

def get_llm(model_str: str):
models = {
"cohere": lambda: ChatCohere(model="command-r"),
"gpt-4": lambda: ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4"),
"claude": lambda: ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3")
}

      if model_str in models:
          return models[model_str]()
      else:
          raise ValueError(f"Model '{model_str}' not supported")

Why These Are Better:

- No loops needed - Direct lookup
- Cleaner syntax - Easy to read
- Faster - O(1) vs O(n) for loops
- Pythonic - Modern Python style

For MVP with just Cohere, even simpler:
def get*llm(model_str: str):
match model_str:
case "cohere":
return ChatCohere(model="command-r")
case *:
raise ValueError(f"Only 'cohere' is supported")

Which approach do you prefer?

> ae we not importing these aka models and then using something like swtch statement s?

● You're absolutely right! I forgot the imports. Here's the complete picture:

Complete Implementation with Imports:

1. Registry (models/registry.py):

# Just the model configurations

MODELS = {
"cohere": {
"provider": "cohere",
"model_name": "command-r"
}, # Future models here
}

2. LLM Selection (responses/llm.py):

# Import the models we need

from langchain_cohere import ChatCohere

# from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI # Future

# from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic # Future

from cortex.models.registry import MODELS

def get_llm(model_str: str): # Get config from registry
if model_str not in MODELS:
raise ValueError(f"Model '{model_str}' not found")

      config = MODELS[model_str]

      # Switch based on provider
      match config["provider"]:
          case "cohere":
              return ChatCohere(model=config["model_name"])
          # case "openai":
          #     return ChatOpenAI(model=config["model_name"])
          case _:
              raise ValueError(f"Provider '{config['provider']}' not supported")

So the flow is:

1. Import the LangChain model classes
2. Import the registry
3. Look up config in registry
4. Use switch statement on provider
5. Return the appropriate model instance

This combines registry lookup + switch statement cleanly!

● Perfect! I've implemented:

1. Created models/ folder with:


    - __init__.py - Makes it a Python package
    - registry.py - Contains MODELS dictionary with Cohere config

2. Implemented responses/llm.py with:


    - Import for ChatCohere (with future imports commented)
    - get_llm() function that:
        - Checks if model exists in registry
      - Gets config from registry
      - Uses match/case statement for clean provider switching
      - Returns configured ChatCohere instance
      - Raises clear errors if model/provider not found

The implementation:

- ✅ Uses your suggested approach (registry + switch statement)
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Ready for future models (just uncomment and add to registry)
- ✅ MVP focused on Cohere only

Next step would be implementing the main ResponsesAPI class. Ready to proceed?

> what about env keys like for ecample i have my env key fro choere CO_API_KEY in .env

● Good point! LangChain automatically looks for API keys in environment variables, but the standard name is COHERE_API_KEY, not CO_API_KEY.

Here are our options:

Option 1: Rename your env variable (Easiest)

In your .env file, change:
CO_API_KEY=your_key
To:
COHERE_API_KEY=your_key

Option 2: Pass the API key explicitly

Update llm.py to use your custom env variable:

● Update(cortex/responses/llm.py)
⎿ Updated cortex/responses/llm.py with 1 addition
1 """LLM selection and configuration for Responses API"""

3 from langchain_cohere import ChatCohere

34 + cohere_api_key=os.getenv("CO_API_KEY") # Use your custom env var
35 )
36 # case "openai":
37 # return ChatOpenAI(

● Done! Now the code will use your CO_API_KEY environment variable. This approach:

- ✅ Works with your existing .env file
- ✅ Explicit about which env var is used
- ✅ Easy to change later if needed

The LLM configuration is now complete and will use your Cohere API key!

32 - temperature=config.get("temperature", 0.7),
33 - cohere_api_key=os.getenv("CO_API_KEY") # Use your custom env var
32 + temperature=config.get("temperature", 0.7)
33 )
34 # case "openai":
35 # return ChatOpenAI(

● Perfect! Now it's clean and standard. Developers using Cortex just need to set:

- COHERE_API_KEY for Cohere
- OPENAI_API_KEY for OpenAI (future)
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for Anthropic (future)

This follows industry standards and makes it easier for developers who are already familiar with LangChain.

● Now we need to implement the main ResponsesAPI class in api.py. This is the core piece that brings everything together!

What the ResponsesAPI Needs to Do:

1. Set up LangGraph StateGraph
2. Implement the create() method (matches OpenAI's API)
3. Handle conversation persistence (previous_response_id)
4. Generate responses using our LLM

Key Components to Plan:

1. Constructor (**init**)

- Initialize checkpointer for persistence
- Set up the StateGraph
- Configure default model

2. StateGraph Setup

- Create workflow with ResponsesState
- Add response generation node
- Connect to END

3. create() Method

- Accept: input, previous_response_id, instructions, model
- Handle conversation threading
- Return response in OpenAI format

4. Response Generation Node

- Convert input to messages
- Apply instructions
- Call LLM
- Format response

Should we plan this out in detail before implementing?

> these methods like openai has like create , get and eoeete and all that i feel like each should be in differnt file in a same folder what do you think of this

✻ Thinking…

The user is suggesting that instead of having all methods (create, get, delete) in a single api.py file, we should separate them into different files within the same folder. This  
 is actually a good architectural pattern - separation of concerns and single responsibility principle. Let me think about how this would look.

For OpenAI's Responses API, they have methods like:

- create() - creates a new response
- get() - retrieves a response by ID
- delete() - deletes a response
- list() - lists responses

Having each in a separate file could look like:
responses/
├── **init**.py
├── api.py (main class that imports all methods)
├── methods/
│ ├── **init**.py
│ ├── create.py
│ ├── get.py
│ ├── delete.py
│ └── list.py

Or even simpler:
responses/
├── **init**.py
├── create.py
├── get.py
├── delete.py
└── list.py

This would make the code more modular and easier to maintain. Each file would focus on one specific operation.

● Excellent idea! Separating methods into different files is much cleaner. Here's how we could structure it:

Proposed Structure:

responses/
├── **init**.py
├── api.py # Main ResponsesAPI class
├── state.py # TypedDict (already done)
├── llm.py # LLM selection (already done)
├── methods/ # All API methods
│ ├── **init**.py
│ ├── create.py # create() method
│ ├── get.py # get() method
│ ├── delete.py # delete() method
│ └── list.py # list() method

Benefits:

- Single Responsibility - Each file handles one method
- Easier Testing - Test each method independently
- Cleaner Code - Shorter, focused files
- Team Friendly - Multiple devs can work on different methods

How It Works:

# api.py

class ResponsesAPI:
def **init**(self): # Setup

      def create(self, ...):
          from .methods.create import create_response
          return create_response(self, ...)

      def get(self, ...):
          from .methods.get import get_response
          return get_response(self, ...)

For MVP, we could start with just create.py since that's the core functionality. What do you think?

● After analyzing the OpenAI Responses API documentation, here's what I found:

OpenAI Responses API Methods:

1. create - POST /v1/responses ✅ ESSENTIAL

- Creates a model response
- Core functionality for generating responses
- Handles conversations via previous_response_id

2. retrieve (get) - GET /v1/responses/{response_id} ⚠️ OPTIONAL

- Retrieves a stored response by ID
- Only useful if store=true was used

3. delete - DELETE /v1/responses/{response_id} ⚠️ OPTIONAL

- Deletes a stored response
- Only needed for cleanup

4. cancel - POST /v1/responses/{response_id}/cancel ❌ SKIP

- Only for background responses (background=true)
- Advanced feature, not needed for MVP

5. list_input_items - GET /v1/responses/{response_id}/input_items ❌ SKIP

- Lists input items for a response
- Advanced feature for debugging

MVP Implementation Plan:

Phase 1 (Essential):

Just implement create() method:
responses/
├── methods/
│ └── create.py # Core functionality

Phase 2 (Nice to have):

Add storage-related methods:
responses/
├── methods/
│ ├── create.py
│ ├── retrieve.py # Get stored response
│ └── delete.py # Delete stored response

Skip for MVP:

- cancel - Background processing complexity
- list_input_items - Not critical for basic usage

Key Parameters for create():

Essential:

- input - User message
- model - Which LLM to use
- previous_response_id - Conversation continuity
- instructions - System prompt

Optional for MVP:

- store - Whether to persist (default: true)
- temperature, top_p - Generation params
- metadata - Custom key-value pairs

This keeps the MVP focused on core conversation functionality while allowing future expansion.
